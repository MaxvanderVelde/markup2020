Dear reader,

Presented above are the components that make up my website, which can be found at [https://maxvandervelde.github.io/](https://maxvandervelde.github.io/). It is a relatively simple website with a few features. It includes a picture of me, some information about me (and whatever it is that i am currently undertaking), my newly updated CV (as of 12/01/2021, that is), a link to my linkedin page and a link that allows you to contact me by way of an email. 

Kind regards,

Max v.d. Velde
